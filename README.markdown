### Project Details

#### General Idea:
I'm working on app that will allow users to purchase a physical 'subscription' to their Instagram feeds for their grandparents. Although my parents and grandparents do use the internet regularly, they don't follow me on social networks so in order for me to share with them, I have to specifically go about emailing them a photo. I find that I upload photos to Instagram every few weeks. However, I only email my grandparents once or twice a year.
 
#### Use case:
I'd like to use the app to automatically keep my grandparents in the loop. I know that it will make my grandparent's day every time they receive a photo in the mail and after a few months they'll have quite a collection. This will all only cost about $1 each photo. I was actually going to setup something similar just for myself using the Instagram and lob.com APIs without a front end in order to achieve this.
